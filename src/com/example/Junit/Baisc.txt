JUnit Examples
JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language.
JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development, 
and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks which is collectively
known as xUnit. JUnit is suitable for only unit testing, not for integration
test. Unit testing is testing small units of codes like methods, or a class,
whereas integration testing invloves complete component or integration between
multiple components.
